No community exists or is planned for this decentralized project. Social links are provided 
as entry points for new users, who are then free to branch out. 
We are more interested in the outcome of the project than the personalities involved.

You are welcome to modify existing projects to fit your needs.
Whether you want to add new features, change the design, 
or use the project as a starting point for something new, 
you are encouraged to do so. However, the original project is
not open to external code contributions via pull requests.

Lythscript is a long-term project (spanning several years), and it will likely undergo significant 
changes in scope and meaning as it evolves. We will prioritize practicality and ease
of use over novel approaches when considering new features. The release date(year) for 
the first version is still being decided. Any technical issue experienced with the initial release will 
be fixed in future updates.

Once our project reaches a milestone of 2 users, we plan to 
make the source code openly available under the permissive BSD 
2-clause License.

Keep in mind this is a personal project, not a professional or academic endeavor,so
we're not focused on strict coding standards or best practices. Feedback is 
accepted on functionality, performance, and other issues.

While we acknowledge the potential benefits and influence of AI and ML,
we do not intend to incorporate them into this project moving forward.

The decision to exclude AI and ML is a design choice, not a restriction on derivative works. 
You can add them to your own custom version of Lythscript.
