The Lythscript community is decentralized, giving you the freedom to branch out. 
We are more interested in the outcome of the project than the personalities involved.

You are welcome to modify existing projects to fit your needs.
Whether you want to add new features, change the design, 
or use the project as a starting point for something new, 
you are encouraged to do so. However, the original project is
closed to external contributions. 
	
The release date(year) for the first version is still being decided. 
Any technical issue experienced with the initial release will 
be fixed in future updates.

Once our project reaches a milestone of 144 users, we plan to 
make the source code openly available under the permissive BSD License 
2-clause License.

Feedback is accepted on functionality, performance, and other issues, 
but not on coding style or best practices.

While we acknowledge the potential benefits and influence of AI and ML,
we do not intend to incorporate them into this project moving forward.
